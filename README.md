# Flight Planner

In this project we were given a flight database and made a program in both Prolog and Java that can answer the following types of questions:
1) “InwhichdaysoftheweekthereisadirectflightfromPlace1toPlace2?”
2) “What are the available flights from Place1 to Place2 on Thursday?”
3) “I need to visit cities C1, C2 and C3, starting my flight in city S on Tuesday and returning to S on Friday. In which sequence should I visit cities C1, C2 and C3 so that I don’t need to have more than one flight a day?”
The goal was to compare the pros and cons between declarative and procedural languages.
